# dictionaries


These are my solutions for the Try It Yourself exercises in chapter 6 of [Python Crash Course](https://nostarch.com/pythoncrashcourse/) by Eric Matthes.

This chapter explores dictionaries how they work, and how to store and grab information stored within them. We apply `for` loops to iterate through the dictionary's `key-value` pairs, or just the `keys`, or just the `values`. We also learn how to nest dictionaries inside a list, lists inside a dictionary, or a dictionary inside of a dictionary.
